# Documentation

This directory contains the documentation for the MAX Toolkit. 

Start with the [MAX Toolkit README.md](../README.md) first, to get an overall idea of MAX Toolkit and its contents. Agent developers should start with the [Integrating an Agent with MAX Library](Integrating_An_Agent_With_MAX_Library.md) document. This documentation goes over all Agent use cases, MAX Library API usage, and multi-agent features enabled by integration. Device or application developers should start with [Integrating a Device with MAX Library](Integrating_A_Device_With_MAX_Library.md). Agent and device or application developers should then read [Integrating with MAX Controls](Integrating_With_MAX_Controls.md), [Integrating with MAX Activities](Integrating_With_MAX_Activities.md), [Integrating with MAX Experiences](Integrating_With_MAX_Experiences.md) and [Overview of MAX Sample Application](Overview_Of_MAX_Sample_Application.md). To build and run the Sample Application refer to the [MAX Sample Application Getting Started Guide](MAX_Sample_Application_Getting_Started_Guide.md).
