 *
 * This interface provides APIs for components of AVS-SDK to manage power resources. These components,
 * such as AudioInputProcessor and SpeechSynthesizer, can claim the level of power resource they need
 * when active (listening or speacking) by invoking the acquirePowerResource API, such that the power
 * management system keeps the hardware devices works in the claimed power levels. When the component
 * is inactive, it invokes the releasePowerResource API to release the acquired power resource level.
 * This interface defined 6 power resource levels. To implement this interface, the user need define
 * a mapping from them to the real power resource levels of the power management system.
